## Initial setup (for new projects)

Unbox a new [Truffle Box](http://truffleframework.com/boxes/). In this example we will use the [Truffle Webpack Box](http://truffleframework.com/boxes/webpack).

`truffle unbox webpack`

## Useful commands

Here are some of the most common and useful commands that you will run in a typical Truffle project:

Compile: `truffle compile`
Migrate: `truffle migrate`
Test: `truffle test`
Console: `truffle develop`
Lint: `npm run lint`
Dev: `npm run dev`
Build: `npm run build`

## Run tests

To run tests you can open a development console (using `truffle develop`) and then run the command `test`.

## Start development

To start development you need to open two consoles. In one console run:

`truffle develop`

In the second console run:

`npm run dev`
